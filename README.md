# Getting Started

## Step 1: Run yarn install

```bash
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Run pod install

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Run from xcode & android studio or bash

# Test

```bash
# using npm
yarn test

```

# Future improvements

Everything can basically be improved here. Better naming, aliases for import, more tests, nicer design (or a design).
